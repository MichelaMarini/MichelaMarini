## Hi there 👋

I'm Michela — a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at the University of Houston.  
I build machine learning pipelines for single-cell image analysis, feature quantification, and phenotypic profiling.


🔍 My research focuses on the quantitative analysis of biological data, with an emphasis on developing computational pipelines for high-throughput microscopy-based imaging. I integrate mathematical modeling, statistical methods, and machine learning to help extract meaningful insights from complex, image-based datasets.

🧠 I’ve worked at the intersection of applied mathematics, AI, and biomedical research — contributing to projects in cancer biology and neuroscience, and collaborating closely with interdisciplinary teams.

📌 Recent work:
- **SPACe**: open-source tool for analyzing Cell Painting data using AI-based segmentation and Earth Mover’s Distance  
- **Astrocyte morphology quantification**: extracting structural features from brain tissue images using cytoskeletal markers and a Morphological Distance metric
- **AIS classification**: applying Fourier analysis and machine learning to study structural changes in neurons
